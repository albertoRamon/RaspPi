### Nomenclature

Define relationship Power System (L/N) & Earth:
|  1st Letter  | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
|    T         | Neutral to earth                        |
|    I         | Neutral to earth throw impedance        |

Define relationship of expose conductors & Earth:
|  2nd Letter  | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|    T         | Expose conductors to Earth                               |
|    N         | Expose conductors to Earthing point of the power System  |

|  TT                                 | TN - S                          | TN - C                          |

| the neutral is usually distributed  | N and PE are separated          | N and PE are the same           |
| In America                          | In Europe                       |                                 |
